# Ethan's Discord Themes
A small collection of themes for Discord, requires [BandagedBD](https://rauenzi.github.io/BetterDiscordApp/).

**Installation**
1. Install BandagedBD
2. Go to `Settings > Themes` in discord and click 'Open Theme Folder'
3. Drag themes into your theme folder to install them.
4. Enable them in `Settings > Themes`.

**The better resizing theme is meant to work with smaller window sizes than Discord's Default Minimum Size!**

Install "ReduceMinimumSize.plugin.js" to your BetterDiscord plugin folder to allow for smaller window sized.
